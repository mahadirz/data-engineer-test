#### Question 1
A simple question which I believe to test efficiency to compute array/vector

#### Question 2
Is the hardest question of all 4, Mostly to test the statistics skill on interpreting data. I believe there are more 
than one way
to solve this question. I really looking forward to see other answers to this question.

#### Question 3
NLP type of questions. The second easier after q1. Not sure though the accuracy is the second ðŸ˜œ, but I think pretty accurate.

I think this one to test pipeline processing of data in distributed manner.
